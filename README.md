## Full stack CRUD App with React in fontend and PHP in backend

## Description

This a simple bird blog website. I have used PHP to create the backend where API routes are created for read, write, update and delete posts. Data are stored into MySQL data base. In the fontend I have used React where data from backed is fetched through Axios and rendered into browser.

This full stack app project is part of my PHP course in Helsinki Business College. I have tried to focus on backend more however the erro handling is not upto the mark yet.
